Over the twenty years of his career, he had only one constant companion, and that was his custom-made, hand-engineered, reinforced combat shotgun. The design was sold off after he vanished, and even now there's a shady guy at every port selling 'the real Harkon Blitzer'|r

Over the twenty years of his career, he had only one constant companion, and that was his custom-made, hand-engineered, reinforced combat shotgun. The design was sold off after he vanished, and even now there's a shady guy at every port selling 'the real Harkon Blitzer'|r
